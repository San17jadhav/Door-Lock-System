# Door-Lock-System
Abstract - To realize the vision of Internet-of-Things (IoT), numerous IoT devices have been developed for improving daily lives, 
in which smart home devices are among the most popular ones. Smart locks rely on smartphones to ease the burden of physical key management 
and keep tracking the door opening/close status, the security of which have aroused great interests from the security community. 
As security is of utmost importance for the IoT environment, we try to investigate the security of   IoT by examining smart lock security.  
We specifically focus on the convenience of the user at operating the lock and control who passes through. 
With the help of a camera which shows anyone whoâ€™s at the door.
